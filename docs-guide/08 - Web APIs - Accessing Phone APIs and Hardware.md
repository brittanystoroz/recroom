# Chapter 8: Web APIs - Accessing Phone APIs and Hardware

JavaScript APIs are being created and enhanced as quickly as devices are. Mozilla's WebAPI effort brings dozens of standard mobile features to JavaScript APIs.

WebAPI is a term used to refer to a suite of device compatibility and access APIs that allow Web apps and content to access device hardware (such as battery status or the device vibration hardware), as well as access to data stored on the device (such as the calendar or contacts list). By adding these APIs, we hope to expand what the Web can do today and only proprietary platforms were able to do in the past.

In Chapter 7 we saw how to set permissions in our application manifest to access certain APIs.  Specifically, our application requested permission to the `audio-channel-content`, `storage`, and `systemXHR` APIs. Let's take a look at how these were used.
